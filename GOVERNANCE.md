# Synthetic Data Properties

- **Conformance**: The synthetic data generated aims to conform to the structures and constraints defined in the corresponding HL7 AU FHIR Implementation Guides, as indicated. Some data may be intentionally non-conformant to support negaitve testing scenarios.

- **Anonymity and Realism**: All data is synthetic, containing no personally identifiable information (PII) or protected health information (PHI). It is generated to approximate real-world properties and relationships found in actual healthcare data to support testing and development. Any resemblance to real entities is purely coincidental.
  - Personas included in the dataset (Patients, Practitioners, PractitionerRoles, Organizations, Healthcare Services and Locations)
    - Names are randomly picked or supplied by Service Australia.
    - Addresses are valid addresses based on publicly available address data from Australia Post.
    - Australian phone numbers are from [the reserved set provided by the Australian Communications and Media Authority for use in creative works](https://www.acma.gov.au/phone-numbers-use-tv-shows-films-and-creative-works). 
    - Email addresses use the following domains set aside for development and testing: 'example', 'myownpersonaldomain domain', and 'my-own-personal-domain domain'. 
    - Resources with an IHI, HPI-I, or HPI-O have been provided by Services Australia and are present in the HI Vendor Test Environment. These resources may be in tests within that environment.
    - IHIs, HPI-Os, HPI-Is are provided by Services Australia for test purposes and will pass Luhn check. 
    - Medicare Card Numbers and DVA numbers are provided by Services Australia for test purposes.
    - Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) Registration Numbers are provided by Services Australia for test purposes.
    - ABNs present in the data for fictious organisations are not valid ABNs, i.e. they will not pass validity checks.
  - Other clinical resources included in the dataset 


- **Unbiased**: The dataset is intended to avoid biases in data representation.

- **Variation**: The dataset aims to exhibit sufficient variation to effectively test different aspects of HL7 AU FHIR IGs, helping to validate a range of expected behaviours and constraints.

- **Data Integrity**: Relationships between different entities are maintained as accurately as possible. For example, *PractitionerRoles* are appropriately linked to *Practitioners* and *Organizations*, reflecting real-world associations.
